# Interactive weather logo

This is the BR Hack Night logo. This uses the [Aeris Weather API](https://www.aerisweather.com/) for all weather information. Initially, the clouds reflex the current weather in Baton Rouge. The dot triggers a search field. Upon search the logo will reflect that location's weather: clear, rainy, etc.

## Roadmap

- Style the weather information and input section
- Better UI
- Reflect current Moon Phase %
